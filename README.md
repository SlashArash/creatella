# Products Grid - ASCII Faces

## Introduction

The project uses CRA to set up a React project. The project uses TypeScript as the main programing language that you can check in the `master` branch, but there is another branch with the name of `javascript` that uses JavaScript for the project. Before starting the coding, I make a simple design in Figma that it's accessible through [this link](https://www.figma.com/file/CUqNf6M7A8yAEmRf0zcvAc/ASCII-Faces?node-id=1%3A2).

## Instruction

To use the project, first of all, you should install the project dependencies.

```
npm ci
```

To run the development server, you can use the following npm script. Running the following command should open the browser on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) for front-end and [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) for the back-end.

```
npm run dev
```

To make a production build, you can use the following npm script.

```
npm run build
```

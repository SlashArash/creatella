Products Grid - ASCII Faces
====

## Introduction
The project uses CRA to set up a React project. The project uses TypeScript as the main programing language that you can check in the `master` branch, but there is another branch with the name of `javascript` that uses JavaScript for the project. Before starting the coding, I make a simple design in Figma that it's accessible through [this link](https://www.figma.com/file/CUqNf6M7A8yAEmRf0zcvAc/ASCII-Faces?node-id=1%3A2).
